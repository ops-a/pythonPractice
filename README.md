## Input and Output: `print()` and `input()`


### For each of the following, print the desired output using only the `print()` function:

1. ```
    I am a cat.
    My name is Rose.
    ```

2. ```
    * * * * *
     * * * *
      * * *
       * *
        *
    ```

3. ```

    + + + + +
    ```

## Variables and assignment

4. Define a variable `name`, put your name in it and print it in the following format:
    > `My name is <name>`
    
    Note: The value `<name>` is the value of the variable jname.

5. Repeat the previous exercise, but instead of a fixed value, take the input for name from the user.

6. Define two variables `firstName` and `lastName`, put your respective first and last names, and print it in the following format:
    > `My first name is <firstName>`

    > `My last name is <lastName>`

7. Repeat the previous exercise, but now take the input for the both the variables from the user.

8. Define a variable `num`, assing 10 to it. Take another variable. Assign it `num` plus 15 and print the values of both num and `numAdd`.

9. Define a `str` variable with the value `"55"`. Convert it to an integer and store it in `num`. Increase num by 15 and print.

### Use the `input()` and `print()` to fulfill the given instructions:

10. Take a string input from the user and print it. Add a suitalbe prompt from your side.

11. Take an integer input from the user and print it. Add a suitable prompt from your side.

12. Take a float input from the user and print it. Add a suitable prompt from your side.

13. Take a string input and print it in the following format:
    #### INPUT
   > `name: 'Anyname'`

   #### OUPUT
   > `Name: Anyname` 

14. Take a string input and print it in the following format:
    #### INPUT
   > `str: 'anything'`

   #### OUPUT
   > ```
   > anythinganythinganything
   > anything anything anything 
   > ``` 


15. Take an integer input, add 10 to it and print the output.

16. Take an integer input, multiply it by 5, and print the output.
